How this works;

1: given a team and start year, we build a 'lineage'

First, all weeks for the season are fetched.
Then, games are fetched and processed by week.


2: Once a lineage is built, espn data(logo, colors) are fetched for each team


3. image processing


4. saving
 first teams are populated.
 then each reign is processed, first saving all games, then creating the reign db object
