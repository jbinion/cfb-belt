		The <span class="highlight">College Football Belt</span> is a fan-created championship system inspired by boxing's title belt concept. The idea is simple: the first-ever college football game established an original champion, and that "belt" has been defended in every game since, changing hands when the current holder loses.

		<li>The belt holder must defend their title in every game they play</li>
		<li>If the belt holder loses, the winner becomes the new champion</li>
		<li>The belt can change hands multiple times in a single season</li>
		<li>Any team can win the belt by defeating the current holder</li>
	</ul>
