		The College Football Belt is an unoffical trophy that traces the lineage of the best teams in
		college football history.
	</p>

	<p>There are three suggested starting points</p>
	<ul class="font-mono text-xs font-bold">
		<li>The first college football game; Rutgers vs Princeton, 1869</li>
		<li>The 1936 Minnesota Golden Gophers</li>
		<li>The 1971 Nebraska Cornhuskers</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Regardless of starting point, all three lineages converge to give us the current, undisputed,
		College Football Belt.
