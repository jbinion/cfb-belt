			<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">What is the College Football Belt?</h2>
			<p>
				The College Football Belt is a fan-created championship system inspired by boxing's title
				belt concept. The idea is simple: the first-ever college football game established an
				original champion, and that "belt" has been defended in every game since, changing hands
				when the current holder loses.

			<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">How Does It Work?</h2>
			<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
				<li>The belt holder must defend their title in every game they play</li>
				<li>If the belt holder loses, the winner becomes the new champion</li>
				<li>The belt can change hands multiple times in a single season</li>
				<li>Any team can win the belt by defeating the current holder</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Belt History</h2>
			<p>
				The concept traces back to the first intercollegiate football game between Rutgers and
				Princeton in 1869. Rutgers won that game, becoming the first belt holder. Since then, the
				belt has changed hands hundreds of times, creating an unofficial but engaging parallel to
				traditional championships.
